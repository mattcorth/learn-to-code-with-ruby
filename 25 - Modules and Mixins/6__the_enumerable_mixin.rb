# A mixin describes a module that we inject into a class to add
# additional behavior. It's a way to share functionality
# between classes without declaring a superclass/subclass hierarchy.
#
# Enumerable module - enables "iteration" for our object
# Enumerable - adjective - able to be counted by one-to-one 
# Automatically defines methods like map, select, reject, any?, and more
#
# 1) Mix in the Enumerable module with the include keyword
# 2) Define an 'each' method

class Refrigerator
  include Enumerable

  attr_reader :snacks, :drinks

  def initialize(snacks:, drinks:)
    @snacks = snacks
    @drinks = drinks
  end

  def items
    snacks + drinks
  end

  def each
    # yield takes a value and gives it to the block attached to each
    items.each { |item| yield item }
  end
end

  snacks: ["Doritos", "Jolly Ranchers", "Ben & Jerry's Ice Cream"],
  drinks: ["Pepsi", "Coke", "Gatorade"]

# fridge.each { |item| puts "#{item} is delicious" }
# p fridge.sort
# p fridge.any? { |item| item.length > 10 }

# p fridge.map { |item| item.upcase }
